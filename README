This is the server code for the 256.bz Media Player Channel.

If you want to install the 256.bz Media Player Private Channel on your
Roku device, please follow the instructions below.

1) copy over and then edit the config.php and config files from the
   defaults in the ./etc/ directory
2) make sure the ./data/ directory is writeable by the httpd user
3) update your host url at http://rokuurlhost.256.bz
4) you should be able to browse to http://rokuurlhost.256.bz/redirect.php
   and it should then redirect you to your categories.php
5) this should give you url XML feed. if it does this, then everything is
   working correctly.
6) install the 256mediaplayer roku application via
   https://owner.roku.com/add/256bz
7) images placed into the images directory will be automatically matched
	against content. imageurl() in library.php explains how matching works

that should be it. now you should be able to watch content from your
network on your Roku.
