copy over and then edit the config.php and config files from the defaults in the ./etc/ directory

make sure the ./data/ directory is writeable by the httpd user

update your host url at http://rokuurlhost.256.bz

you should be able to browse to http://rokuurlhost.256.bz/redirect.php and it should then redirect you to your categories.php

this should give you url XML feed. if it does this, then everything is working correctly.

install the 256mediaplayer roku application via https://owner.roku.com/add/256bz

that should be it.
